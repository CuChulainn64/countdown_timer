# countdown_timer
a simple countdown timer for use on streams
The file you want to open is timer3.exe.
Enter the time when you want the timer to end. Not how long you want the timer to run.
The timer defaults to 5:00pm. If you enter a time that has already passed,
for example, you enter 9:00pm at 9:05pm, the timer will count down to the target time on the following day.

Time is outputed to the file "Timer.txt" on each tick. Add that file as a text source 
to include it on stream.
